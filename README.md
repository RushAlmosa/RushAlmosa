<h1 align="center">👽 Greetings, Earthlings! I'm Rush Almosa, your friendly neighborhood developer!</h1>
<h3 align="center">🚀 I'm a backend developer from the land of precision and punctuality, Germany, and I'm passionate enough to code an entire spaceship if I have to! When I'm not busy brewing up some mean code or roasting bugs, you might find me enjoying a good cup of tee or exploring the great outdoors!</h3>

- 🛠️ Currently Building: [My Super Secret Project](https://github.com/RushAlmosa/Al-Mudir) (It's so secret, it's currently set to private! But hey, if you're as curious and excited as a cat, just drop me a message and I might just give you a sneak peek! 😉)
- 🎓 Currently Learning: Cybersecurity (Because who doesn't want to write the most secure code, right? I'm on a mission to make the digital world a safer place, one line of code at a time!)
- 🤝 Looking to Collaborate on: **Open Source Projects** (Let's create something that even aliens would want to fork!)
- 🆘 Looking for Help? (Yes, even I need help sometimes. After all, no one is perfect!) Also, if you're stuck with something, don't hesitate to reach out! I'm always here to lend a helping hand when I can and if time permits. Let's learn and grow together!

### 🎮 Impossible Game (Can you win this?)
Try to solve this impossible riddle! Can you find the answer?
<summary>What is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon and three in the evening?</summary>
<details>
  <summary>Click here to reveal the answer.</summary>
  It's a human. The riddle is a metaphor for the stages of life. A baby crawls on four legs (morning, or the start of life), then walks on two legs (noon, or the middle of life), and then uses a cane in old age (evening, or the end of life). But wait, you said an impossible game, right? Well, the impossible part is... you just lost The Game! 😄
